   - Use uniform typography and labeling

3. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Tooltips for detailed information
   - Click/tap for additional details
   - Filtering and zooming controls
   - Legend toggles to show/hide series

4. **Accessibility Considerations:**
   - Color is not the only means of conveying information
   - Patterns/textures as supplements to color
   - Text alternatives for screen readers
   - Keyboard navigation for interactive elements

### Dashboard Design

1. **Layout Principles:**
