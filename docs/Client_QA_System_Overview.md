# Perera Construction Lead Agent: Q&A and System Overview

## Introduction

The Perera Construction Lead Generation Agent is designed to automate the discovery, qualification, and management of high-quality construction leads throughout Southern California. This system systematically monitors numerous data sources, applies intelligent filtering based on Perera's specific requirements, and delivers qualified leads directly to your HubSpot CRM.

This document addresses key follow-up questions about the system's capabilities, configuration, and operations to provide clarity on how the solution works and can be maintained.

## üîç Data Sources & Relevance

### Current Sources
The system is designed to handle 50-100+ sources simultaneously. The initial configuration includes a representative sample of high-value sources:

- LA Department of Building and Safety Services Portal
- San Diego Development Services Department
- Irvine Planning Commission
- Orange County Public Works
- Construction Dive RSS Feed
- ENR Southern California News Feed
- SoCal Healthcare Planning Bulletins
- California Educational Facility Planning Portal
- San Bernardino County Development Services
- Major University Planning & Development Feed (USC, UCLA, etc.)

Adding more sources is a straightforward configuration task that doesn't require code changes.

### SoCal Relevance
The system includes specific configurations for key Southern California portals and implements core location validation logic that filters for configured SoCal regions. Currently configured regions include:

- Los Angeles County (LA City, Long Beach, Pasadena, etc.)
- Orange County (Irvine, Anaheim, Santa Ana, etc.)
- San Diego County (San Diego City, Oceanside, etc.)
- Riverside County
- San Bernardino County
- Ventura County

The target geography can be easily refined by updating the configuration files with additional cities or counties.

### NLP Accuracy
The "85%+ NLP accuracy" metric comes from internal testing using a curated dataset of sample lead texts where key information (market sector, location entities) was manually verified. We ran the system's NLP component (spaCy + custom rules) against this data and calculated standard metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score). An F1-score exceeding 0.85 for Market Sector classification indicates high reliability in correctly categorizing leads based on text content. Accuracy for specific entity extraction (like Location) was measured similarly.

### Qualified Lead Definition
The system applies the following exact criteria to determine if a lead is qualified:

1. **Required Fields Present**: Must include title, source_url, location, and description
2. **Target Market Match**: Location must be within configured SoCal target areas
3. **Target Sector Match**: Must match one of the configured market sectors
4. **Confidence Score**: Must have a confidence score >= 0.7
5. **Recency**: Must be less than 14 days old (configurable)
6. **Not Duplicate**: Must not match existing leads (threshold: 85% similarity)

### Customization
Yes, all qualification rules are customizable via configuration files. This includes the confidence score threshold, recency window, deduplication sensitivity, required fields, target locations, and keywords used for filtering.

## üîÅ HubSpot Integration

### Deduplication Handling
The system implements deduplication at two levels:

1. **System Pre-Check**: Before sending to HubSpot, the system checks the lead against a local cache/database of recently processed leads (configurable window, e.g., 30 days) using fuzzy matching on title/URL (configurable threshold, e.g., 85% similarity) to reduce obvious redundant processing.

2. **HubSpot Native Logic (Primary)**: The core deduplication relies on HubSpot itself. When creating Companies or Contacts, the integration code first searches HubSpot (using the `HubSpotClient`'s `find_or_create_...` logic) for existing records based on unique identifiers (Company Name, Contact Email). If a match is found, the existing record ID is used for association, preventing duplicate creation. New Deals are typically created and associated with the found/newly created Company/Contact.

### Sandbox Testing
Absolutely. We strongly recommend and fully support testing the entire integration in your HubSpot Sandbox environment before production deployment. The system uses a configurable API key, making it easy to switch between Sandbox and Production.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance

### Credentials Handling
All sensitive credentials (HubSpot API Key, any potential source-specific keys/logins) are managed exclusively through environment variables loaded via a central configuration module. **They are never hardcoded in the source code or configuration files.** Source configurations that require authentication store only the *name* of the environment variable containing the secret, not the secret itself.

### External Dependencies
The system relies on standard, well-maintained open-source Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`). There are no proprietary or obscure external runtime dependencies. Network access is required for scraping sources and interacting with the HubSpot API.

### Hardcoded Values
The design explicitly avoids hardcoded values for configuration items like API keys, file paths, thresholds, keywords, or mappings. All such parameters are managed through environment variables or dedicated configuration files (`.json`, `.py`).

## üìÑ PDF Parsing & City Compatibility

### PDF Parsing
The current version focuses on extracting data from HTML web pages, RSS/Atom feeds, and JSON APIs. It does **not** include built-in functionality for parsing text or structured data directly from PDF documents, as this requires different techniques (like OCR). However, the system's modular design allows for a PDF parsing module to be added as a future enhancement if specific high-value PDF sources are identified.

### City Compatibility
The system is designed for compatibility across different municipalities. While initial configurations focused on LA, San Diego, and Irvine examples, adapting to other SoCal cities (like Santa Ana) primarily involves configuring the specific CSS selectors for that city's portal(s) in the `selectors.json` file. The core Playwright scraping engine can handle diverse website structures given the correct selectors.

## üß∞ Maintenance & Documentation

### Maintenance Guide Example
The maintenance documentation includes the following key sections:

**Configuration Updates:**
- *Adding/Updating Sources:* Steps to edit `sources.json` (URL, type, market sectors, credentials reference).
- *Updating Keywords:* Steps to edit `keywords.json`.
- *Updating Selectors:* Steps to edit `selectors.json` for website structure changes (requires basic CSS selector knowledge).
- *Adjusting Thresholds:* Steps to modify settings in `.env` (e.g., confidence score, recency).
- *HubSpot Mapping:* Steps to update `.env` with new custom field names or stage IDs.

**Monitoring:** How to check logs and system status (mentioning the optional dashboard or monitoring script outputs).

**Troubleshooting:** Common issues (API key errors, source connectivity failures) and basic resolution steps.

**Dependency Updates:** Recommendation to periodically update Python libraries (`pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`).

**Code Maintenance:** Note that significant website redesigns or core system bugs require Python development expertise for code changes.

### Target Audience
Configuration tasks are designed for technically comfortable users. Core code maintenance requires developer involvement.

## üñ•Ô∏è UI Roadmap

A lightweight web dashboard (e.g., Streamlit) focused on **Monitoring** (status, metrics, logs), **Lead Review** (viewing processed leads, filtering), and potentially **Basic Management** (viewing sources). It is intended to provide visibility for technical and non-technical staff, including BD teams, to observe system performance and lead flow.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Licensing & Deployment

### Licensing/IP
Upon project completion and payment, Perera Construction receives full ownership and rights to the custom codebase developed for this agent.

### Third-Party Licenses
The system utilizes standard open-source libraries with permissive licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.) suitable for commercial use.

### Deployment
There are two primary options for deployment:

1. **Self-Hosting:** We provide Docker configuration (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`) and documentation for your team to deploy and manage the agent on your own cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP).

2. **Managed Service Option:** Alternatively, we offer a managed service including hosting, monitoring, proactive maintenance (crucial for scraper updates), support, and optimization. We can also discuss bundling management of other related technologies into a cost-effective package.
