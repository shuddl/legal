## Known Limitations

The following limitations were identified during testing:

1. **City Portal Scraper Robustness**: Some city portals with non-standard layouts may require manual configuration adjustments.

2. **Enrichment Data Quality**: Company data enrichment depends on the quality of third-party data sources, which may have gaps for smaller companies.

3. **Classification Edge Cases**: Unusual project descriptions with limited information may result in lower classification confidence.

4. **Performance Under Extreme Load**: System performance degrades when processing batches larger than 1,000 leads simultaneously.

5. **API Rate Limiting**: External API rate limits may affect enrichment throughput during high-volume processing.

## Testing Artifacts

The following testing artifacts are available for review:

- Test Plans: `/tests/test_plans/`
- Test Results: `/tests/results/`
- Test Coverage Reports: `/tests/coverage/`
- Performance Test Data: `/tests/performance/`
- Security Test Reports: `/tests/security/`

## Attestation Statement

Based on the comprehensive testing conducted, we attest that the Construction Lead Scraper system:

1. Meets all functional requirements as specified in the requirements documentation
