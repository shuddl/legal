Estimated project cost: $78,500,000
Proposed construction timeline: Start - September 2023, Completion - December 2025

SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES:

1. Transportation and Circulation
   Significant Impact: Increased traffic at three key intersections
   Mitigation: TRA-1: Traffic signal optimization at identified intersections
   Mitigation: TRA-2: Contribution to transit improvement fund
   Residual Impact: Less than significant with mitigation

2. Air Quality
   Significant Impact: Construction-related emissions exceeding regional thresholds
   Mitigation: AQ-1: Tier 4 construction equipment requirements
   Mitigation: AQ-2: Dust control measures
   Residual Impact: Less than significant with mitigation

3. Noise
   Significant Impact: Construction noise impacts to adjacent residential properties
   Mitigation: NOI-1: Limited construction hours
   Mitigation: NOI-2: Noise barriers during construction
   Residual Impact: Less than significant with mitigation

4. Cultural Resources
   Significant Impact: Potential impacts to archaeological resources during excavation
   Mitigation: CUL-1: Archaeological monitoring during ground-disturbing activities
   Mitigation: CUL-2: Treatment protocol for unanticipated discoveries
   Residual Impact: Less than significant with mitigation

ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED:
1. No Project Alternative
2. Reduced Density Alternative (180 residential units, 20,000 sf commercial)
3. Commercial-Only Alternative (no residential component)
4. Alternative Site Location
